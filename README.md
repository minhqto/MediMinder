###### Medi-Minder is a mobile application that keeps user-digestible information on each medication prescribed to the user to allow the user to be aware of what effects the medication should be and what possible side-effects are. This allows the user to be more alert to their response to the medication. Medi-Minder, also, tracks whether the user has taken their medications within their prescribed cycle, and sets a streak for days that pills have been taken!

###### Unlike, many medication reminder applications, the focus of Medi-Minder is also to connect users to their healthcare professional to: keep track if medication is taken properly and keep track of moods and possible side-effects the patient may have after taking the medication. This allows users and healthcare professionals to check that the medication is performing as intended without having to wait until the next appointment date!
